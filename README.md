# Mathematics-of-Imaging-Science
This is a course for graduate student at WashU engineering school, 
Here we talk about some mathematical definition that is indispable for imaging science,
something like Hilbert Space, Fouries Transform, Statistical Theory and understanding of this concepts in my view.
